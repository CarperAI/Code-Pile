# Code-Pile
This repository contains the processing scripts to scrape/process the code-pile dataset.


# flowpoints notes

Here's my concept of how the "Code-Pile" could be organized:

This is the main repository for the "Code-Pile" dataset.

* [The code pile proposal](https://carperai.notion.site/Code-Pile-Organization-adfe8babbe07451cbd489a50cc0c985a)
* [preliminary spreadsheet of useful resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OrOnv-Cv1wRq0jNk4AegHiMtLk88YQDz5b1TP-o5SE8/edit#gid=0)

The code pile will be released similar to "the pile" as a folder of .jsonl.zst files, see [lm-dataformat](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm_dataformat)

```
@misc{Code-Pile,
  author = {Lisa, Mona and Bot, Hew},
  doi = {},
  month = {},
  title = {{My Research Software}},
  url = {https://github.com/CarperAI/Code-Pile},
  version = {},
  year = {2022}
}
```
