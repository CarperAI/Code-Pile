### Dataset Summary

Competitive Programming Dataset Take From CodeContest and Google CodeJam.

### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards

[More Information Needed]

### Languages

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

[More Information Needed]

### Data Fields

[More Information Needed]

### Data Splits

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

Competitive programming is a popular type of competition centered around solving algorithmic problems. The problems are usually presented as a set of input data and a set of output data. The goal is to write a program that takes the input data and produces the output data. Having a large dataset of competitive programming problems can be useful for training machine learning models to solve these types of problems.
